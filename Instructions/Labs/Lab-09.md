# Lab 9: Deploy and Run the HR/Payroll Copilot Application

### Estimated Duration: 120 minutes

**Smart Agent: At the heart of the solution is the Python object Smart_Agent. The agent has the following components:**

  - **Goals/Tasks:** Smart_Agent is given a persona and instructions to follow to achieve certain goals; for example, HR Copilot is about helping answer HR/Payroll questions and update employees' personal information. This is done using instructions specified in the system message.

  - **NLP interaction and tool execution:** For the ability to use multiple tools and functions to accomplish business tasks, the function calling capability of the 0613 version is utilized to intelligently select the right function (validate identity, search the knowledge base, update address, create ticket) based on the agent's judgment of what needs to be done. The agent is also able to engage with users by following the instructions and goals defined in the system message.

  - **Memory:** The agent maintains a memory of the conversation history. The memory is backed by Streamlit's session state.
  - **LLM:** The agent is linked to a 0613 GPT-4 model to power its intelligence.

## Lab objectives

You will be able to complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Build your own HR/Payroll copilot locally
- Task 2: Integrate Azure Cognitive Search with your Application
- Task 3: Deploy the HR/Payroll Copilot application to Azure
    
### Task 1: Build your own HR/Payroll copilot locally

**HR/Payroll Copilot**: The HR/Payroll Copilot is a locally hosted application designed to assist with HR and payroll-related tasks. It integrates with Azure OpenAI and Cognitive Search to perform functions such as:

- **Employee Identity Verification**: Confirming employee identity based on provided credentials.
- **Information Queries**: Answering questions related to HR policies, payroll schedules, or other employee concerns.
- **Information Updates**: Allowing employees to submit requests for updates to their personal information, such as address changes, and logging these requests for HR review.

By running this application locally, you can test and interact with its features to ensure it functions as intended before deployment in a production environment.


1. In the LabVM, open File Explorer, navigate to the below-mentioned path, right-click on the `secrets.env` file, and select open with  **Visual Studio Code**.

   ```
   C:\Labfiles\OpenAIWorkshop\scenarios\incubations\copilot
   ```

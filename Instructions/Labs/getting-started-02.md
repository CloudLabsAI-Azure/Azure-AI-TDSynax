# Hands-on Lab: Conversational AI with Bot Service using Power Virtual Agents

### Overall Estimated Duration: 1 Hour

## Overview
The Hands-on Lab: Conversational AI with Bot Service using Power Virtual Agents introduces participants to building intelligent chatbots using Microsoft's Power Virtual Agents, a no-code/low-code tool. This lab guides users through creating conversational flows, integrating with external services using Power Automate, and enhancing the bot's functionality to address real-world scenarios. Participants will learn how to customize bots, implement AI-driven capabilities for natural language understanding, and deploy their bots across multiple channels like websites or Microsoft Teams. By the end of the lab, users will have a functional chatbot capable of delivering automated, dynamic responses to user queries.

## Objective

This session provides hands-on experience in creating and customizing intelligent chatbots using Microsoft Power Virtual Agents, leveraging its no-code interface. Participants will learn how to integrate chatbots with external services, enhance their functionality with AI-driven natural language understanding, and deploy them across various channels for practical, real-world applications.

- **Conversational AI with Bot Service using Power Virtual Agents** - Building conversational AI solutions with Power Virtual Agents and integrating them with other services.

## Pre-requisites

- Microsoft Account: Access to a Microsoft account with permissions to use Power Virtual Agents and Power Automate.
- Basic Understanding of Chatbots: Familiarity with the concept of chatbots and conversational AI.
- Access to Microsoft Power Platform: A valid subscription or trial for Power Virtual Agents and Power Automate.

## Architecture
The architecture for this lab series involves several key Azure services working together to provide a comprehensive AI and machine learning environment. The core components include Azure OpenAI Service for leveraging advanced language models, Azure Machine Learning for training and deploying machine learning models, and Azure Cognitive Services for adding capabilities like vision, speech, and language understanding. Additionally, Power Virtual Agents is used for building conversational AI, while Microsoft Defender for Cloud ensures security and compliance. The architecture also integrates Azure Storage for data management and Azure Functions for serverless computing, creating a robust and scalable AI solution.

### Task 2: Understanding the Implementation of the Recommendation Service

The Recommendation service implements the RAG pattern using the Semantic Kernel SDK. The details of the implementation are captured in the Jupyter Notebook in the folder miyagi/sandbox/usecases/rag/dotnet. You can open the notebook in VSCode and run the cells to understand step-by-step details of how the Recommendation Service is implemented. Pay special attention to how the RAG pattern is implemented using Semantic Kernel. Select the kernel as .NET Interactive in the top right corner of the notebook.

1. In the Visual Studio Code, navigate to **miyagi (1)/sandbox (2)/usecases (3)/rag (4)/dotnet (5)** folder and select **Getting-started.ipynb (6)**

   ![](../media/miyagi-image19.png)

1. **Execute the notebook cell by cell** (using either Ctrl + Enter to stay on the same cell or Shift + Enter to advance to the next cell) and observe the results of each cell execution.
  

   > **Note**: Make sure **.Net Interactive** is ready. If not, please wait for 2 to 3 minutes. If it is still not loading, kindly close and reopen Visual Studio. Also, please do not click on the **Run All** option to execute all the cells simultaneously, which may lead to exceeding the token limit, resulting in Error: 503 â€“ Service unreachable. 

      ![](../media/miyagi-image20.png)
   
   > **Note**: In case any issues or errors occur related to exceeding the call rate limit of your current OpenAI S0 pricing tier, please wait for 15 to 20 seconds and Re-run the cell

### Task 3: Run the Recommendation Service Locally
In this task, you will run the recommendation service locally by using Visual Studio Code to build and run the service in the terminal. Then, verify its functionality by accessing the Swagger page in the browser.

1. Open a new terminal: by navigating through **miyagi (1)/services (2)/recommendation-service (3)** and right-clicking on **dotnet (4).** In the cascading menu, select **Open in Intergate Terminal (5)**.

    ![](../media/task4-1.png)

1. Run the following command to run the recommendation service locally:
    
   ```
   dotnet build
   dotnet run
   ```

   > **Note**: Let the command run. Meanwhile, you can proceed to the next step.
   > **Note:** The commands dotnet build and dotnet run are fundamental in .NET Core and .NET 5+ environments for building and running .NET applications locally on your machine.

1. Open another tab in Edge. In the browser window, paste the following link:

   ```
   http://localhost:5224/swagger/index.html 
   ```

   **Note**: Refresh the page continuously until you get the swagger page for the recommendation service, as depicted in the image below.

   ![](../media/miyagi-image21.png)


### Task 4: Run the Miyagi Frontend Locally
In this task, you will run the Miyagi frontend locally by installing dependencies using npm and yarn and then starting the development server. You will verify its functionality by accessing the local development server in the browser.

1. Open a new terminal: By navigating **miyagi/ui (1)** and right-clicking on **ui/typescript (2)**. In the cascading menu, select **Open in intergate Terminal (3)**.

   ![](../media/image-rg-25.png)

1. Run the following command to install the dependencies
   
    ```
    npm install --global yarn
    yarn install
    yarn dev
    ```

   > **Note**: Please wait till the command gets executed successfully. It will take up to 5 minutes. Once the **yarn dev** command starts executing, wait for 2 minutes and proceed with the next step.
   
   > **Note**: These commands (npm install --global yarn, yarn install, and yarn dev) are indeed essential in JavaScript and TypeScript projects for managing dependencies and running scripts necessary to set up and run applications. They ensure that all required packages are installed (yarn install), and they execute development scripts (yarn dev) defined in the project's configuration (package.json).

1. Open a new tab in Edge and browse the following:

   ```
   http://localhost:4001
   ```

   >**Note:** You can get the port from the logs in the terminal.

      ![](../media/error-pop-up.png)

   >**Note:** If you encounter an **Unhandled Runtime Error** pop-up, close it and dismiss the error message at the bottom left corner.

     ![](../media/error-side.png)
   

### Task 5: Persist Embeddings in Azure AI Search

In this task, you will persist embeddings in Azure AI Search by executing a POST request in Swagger UI, verifying the execution, and then confirming the creation of the index in the Azure portal.

1. Navigate back to the **swagger UI** page, scroll to **Memory** session, click on **POST/datasets (1)** for expansion, and click on **Try it out (2)**.

   ![](../media/miyagi-image22.png)

1. Replace the below **code (1)** with the below code, and click on **Execute (2)**.

     ```
     {
        "metadata": {
              "userId": "50",
              "riskLevel": "aggressive",
              "favoriteSubReddit": "finance",

            },
          "dataSetName": "intelligent-investor"
      }
      ```

     ![](../media/miyagi-image(23).png)
